### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nguyen Ly and I am a senior at the University of Massachusetts Boston studying computational mathematics with a concentration in computer science. 

### Projects 

#### Analysis of Spotify Million Playlist Dataset Challenge :musical_note: | [GitHub Repostitory](https://github.com/nguyenlly/math448_proj)
- Designed dataset and converted JSON files to csv from Spotify Million Playlist Dataset Challenge using Python and Excel.
- Cleaned, merged, and validated multiple datasets of over 2.2 million data points from Spotify and Kaggle using R.
- Utilized statistical methods such as ggplot, scatterplot, correlation test, chi-square test, permutation test, ANOVA test, and linear regression analysis to determine which metrics can be utilized to measure user interaction and music recommendation.

#### Analysis of Marvel TV Series :tv: | [GitHub Repostitory](https://github.com/nguyenlly/math345_proj)
- Collected, cleaned, and validated data from IMBD, Rotten Tomatoes, Wikipedia, and Mergent Online using Excel and R.
- Designed and implemented a statistical analysis to cross-examined critics and audience scores from IMBD and Rotten Tomatoes
with character appearance and viewing method (streaming services or broadcasting).
- Utilized statistical methods to create a predictive model for the success of newly released series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
#### Social Behavioral Analysis of Penguins at Aquarium of the Pacific :penguin:
- Collected random observations of penguin preening using a live webcam for 30-minute intervals every day for two months.
- Used penguin profiles to differentiate penguins to categorize penguin preening with social relationships within the colony.
- Used packages such as mosaic to analyze data through correlation, hypothesis, and ANOVA testing validity of data and its
significance due to the small sample size.
